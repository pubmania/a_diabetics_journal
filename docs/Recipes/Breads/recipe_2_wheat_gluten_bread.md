# No Egg Wheat Gluten Bread

What a lovely recipe and my absolute favourite :green_heart:. Nothing comes closer to the real bread than this recipe in my experience. It tastes great toasted, with eggs and can basically replace the traditional bread for a diabetic.

I came across the original recipe on a diabetes forum. I have, however, made minor modifications and adjustments.

!!! tip
    1. You can add various seeds, olives, onions, garlic etc to make different artisan breads. I have tried a number of variations and they all come out good.
    2. Instead of making rolls, you can bake it in bread pan to get 16 slices.
    3. For easy cutting using a pizza cutter, the dough can be rolled flat. Although in this case bake time should be reduced to 10 or 15 minutes.

!!! danger
    As this recipe is based mainly on wheat gluten, it is not suitable for those with Gluten Intolerance. I am sure it's obvious but still.
