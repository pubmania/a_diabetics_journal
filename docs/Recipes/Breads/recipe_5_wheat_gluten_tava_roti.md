While the traditional wheat flour roti is not an option with low carb / keto diet it is possible to get closer to the taste using Soya flour. The [Tava Roti](recipe_1_tava_roti.md) recipe is fine but feels a bit brittle. This recipe is great though as I felt it was almost like the real deal.

Take  @Soya Flour{1/2%cup} and @vital wheat gluten{2%tbsp}.

Flatten them using a #roller pin or tortilla press{}.
