# No Egg Wheat Gluten Bread

What a lovely recipe. Nothing comes closer to the real bread than this recipe in my experience. It tastes great toasted, with eggs and can basically replace the traditional bread for a diabetic.

I came across the original recipe on a diabetes forum. I have, however, made minor modifications and adjustments.

!!! tip
    You can add various seeds, olives, onions, garlic etc to make different artisan breads. I have tried a number of variations and they all come out good.
