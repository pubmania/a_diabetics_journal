title: Prepare for diabetic diet

## Prepare

Prepare by having key ingredients to help with mostly vegetarian keto / low carb diet. I try and make sure that I have following items in my pantry at all times - especially the ones with :green_heart:. 

While these are easily available, I have provided links for the ones I use and from where I order - mostly Amazon.

## Pantry

!!! warning "Caution"
    It's easy to get lured into the ultra processed foods while trying low carb alternatives, so please do keep an eye on ingredients and avoid overuse of products with additives, flavourings etc. 

    UPF, if had regularly, can cause havoc on your gut microbiome. One can read more about this in the book ["Ultra-Processed People: The Science Behind the Food That Isn't Food" by Dr. Chris van Tulleken](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/62586003).

    Any item that can be classed as `ultra processed` is marked with :red_circle: and `possibly ultra processed` is marked with :orange_circle: in the list below. 

    My `favourites` are marked with :green_heart:.

-   Unsweetened Peanut Butter

-   :orange_circle: [Confectioners Swerve](https://kutt.it/swerve){target=_blank}

	??? warning "Caution"
		It is unclear to me if this can be categorised as ultra-processed or not and there are [recent studies casting a doubt on it being safe](https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/trouble-erythritol){target=_blank}. I have, therefore, reduced it's usage significantly.

		Although a large number of dishes on net use this, I wouldn't be quick on ordering this because I dont find its taste great and none of the recipes on my list need this ingredient.
