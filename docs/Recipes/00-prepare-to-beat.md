title: Prepare for diabetic diet

## Prepare

Prepare by having key ingredients to help with mostly vegetarian keto / low carb diet. I try and make sure that I have following items in my pantry at all times - especially the ones with :green_heart:. 

While these are easily available, I have provided links for the ones I use and from where I order - mostly Amazon.

## Pantry

!!! warning "Caution"
    It's easy to get lured into the ultra processed foods while trying low carb alternatives, so please do keep an eye on ingredients and avoid overuse of products with additives, flavourings etc. 
	
	UPF, if had regularly, can cause havoc on your gut microbiome. One can read more about this in the book ["Ultra-Processed People: The Science Behind the Food That Isn't Food" by Dr. Chris van Tulleken](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/62586003).
	
	Any item that can be classed as `ultra processed` is marked with :red_circle: and `possibly ultra processed` is marked with :orange_circle: in the list below. 
	
	My `favourites` are marked with :green_heart:.

	??? Tip
		Can be prepared at home by simply heating the unsalted butter in a pan until it starts bubbling and becomes clear.

-   Full Fat Greek Yogurt 

	--- 
	
	??? warning "Beware"
		Sainsburys brand is what I use. It must be used only sparingly as it does have about 4.5g carbs per 100gms

	
-   Unsweetened Peanut Butter

	---

	??? Tip "Get Both Versions"
		1. [Smooth](https://kutt.it/smooth_peanut_butter){target=_blank}
		2. [Crunchy](https://kutt.it/crunchy_peanut_butter){target=_blank}
	
-   :orange_circle: [Confectioners Swerve](https://kutt.it/swerve){target=_blank}

	---

	??? warning "Caution"
		It is unclear to me if this can be categorised as ultra-processed or not and there are [recent studies casting a doubt on it being safe](https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/trouble-erythritol){target=_blank}. I have, therefore, reduced it's usage significantly.

		*23g carb per 100g - no adverse impact on my BG. Your mileage may vary.*

-   [Psyllium Husk](https://kutt.it/psyllium_husk){target=_blank}

	??? warning "Caution"
		Although a large number of dishes on net use this, I wouldn't be quick on ordering this because I dont find its taste great and none of the recipes on my list need this ingredient.

	---
	??? danger "Ingredients"
		Tomatoes (200g Per 100g Tomato Ketchup), Spirit Vinegar, Lemon Juice From Concentrate, Potassium Chloride, Acid (Malic Acid), Citrus Fibre, :small_red_triangle: Spice And Herb Extracts (Contain Celery), :small_red_triangle: Sweetener (Sucralose)
