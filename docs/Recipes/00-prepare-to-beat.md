# Prepare for diabetic diet

## Prepare

Prepare by having key ingredients to help with keto / low carb diet. Following items must be in your pantry at all times. While these are easily available, I have provided links for the ones I use and from where I order - mostly Amazon.

## Pantry

!!! warning "Caution"
    It's easy to get lured into the overuse of the ultra processed foods while trying low carb alternatives, so please do keep an eye on ingredients and avoid additives, flavourings etc from overuse. These if had regularly can cause havoc on your gut microbiome. Any item that can be classed as ultra processed is marked with :red_circle: and possibly processed is marked with :small_orange_diamond: in the list below.
