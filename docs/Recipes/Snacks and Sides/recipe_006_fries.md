Tastes great with [Tomato Mint Pepper Spinach Dip](../Dips/recipe_007_mint_spinach_dip.md), [Tzatziki Dip](../Dips/recipe_009_tzatziki_dip.md) and [Basil Mint Pepper Garlic Dip](../Dips/recipe_012_basil_mint_dip.md).

!!! Info
    This can be prepared using Celeriac or Swede. I have found that while celeriac does not raise my BG, Swede at times does. There are people for whom both work just fine. I would suggest try both and see the impact. Personally, I do like Swede better but as it does spike my BG at times, I try to avoid it.

Cut @Swede or Celeriac{500%gms(1 Large)} into long fries sized pieces using #knife{}.
Wash and dry the cut pieces and place them in #Air Fryer{} basket.
Add @Extra Virgin Olive Oil{6%tablespoons}, @Pink Himalayan Salt{1%teaspoon}.
Mix it well so the surface of Celeriac / Swede is all coated with the oil.
Put it on air fry at 180 C for ~{25-30%minutes}.
Keep shaking the air fryer basket every 10 minutes so the celeriac is crisp on all sides.
Once done, sprinkle @black pepper{to taste}, @red chilli flakes{to taste}.
Serve hot.
