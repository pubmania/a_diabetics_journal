title: Tomato Keftedes (Fried Santorini Tomato Balls / Tomato Fritters)
---

While the original recipe uses flour, I replaced it with the combination of wheat gluten and almond flour and it turned out great.

Tastes great with [Tomato Mint Pepper Spinach Dip](../Dips/recipe_007_mint_spinach_dip.md), [Tzatziki Dip](../Dips/recipe_009_tzatziki_dip.md) and [Basil Mint Pepper Garlic Dip](../Dips/recipe_012_basil_mint_dip.md).
