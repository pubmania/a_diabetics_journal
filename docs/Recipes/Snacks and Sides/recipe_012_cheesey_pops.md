I recently tried [Cheddar Cheesies](https://www.cheesies.co.uk/products/cheddar-cheesies) and loved it. I figured it should be possible to make these at home and found this to be really easy actually. 

I do feel there is not a huge amount of cost saving when made at home but batches I made at home tasted much better and fresh plus with the added advantage of making these with my own flavours. Both batches I made turned out very delicious indeed.

The one downside is, the huge prep time. Also it did not taste as good as when had on the same day these were prepared, there really is no incentive to make larger batches. Although I must admit I did not store them in a vaccum sealed container and perhaps that might make a difference. That said, I think leaving the cheese to dehydrate overnight is not much of a problem and I can then have these freshly made so I don't think I will bother with testing storage anytime soon.

If you want your cheesy pops to be same shape as [Cheddar Cheesies](https://www.cheesies.co.uk/products/cheddar-cheesies) then using a #knife cut the @Extra Mature Cheddar Cheese{500%gms} into small ¼ inch squares else just use grated extra mature cheddar cheese which is much easier.

Transfer the cut or grated cheese into the #Air Fryer Basket{} and spread evenly.

Select `Dehydrate` function on the #Air Fryer{} set to 70C for {8-12%hours}.

Once dehydrated, empty the Air Fryer Basket and remove all the oil left by cheese before placing the dehydrated cheese back in the air fryer.

Now air fry the dehydrated cheese at 180C for about {6-8%minutes}.

Empty the popped cheese onto an open plate and leave to cool down for {5%minutes}.

Enjoy with some coffee or tea.
