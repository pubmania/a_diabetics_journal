:heart: This recipe has a lovely story behind it. :smile:

First-off it is not one of my experiements but that of my lovely daughter. She wanted to make something special for me on Father's Day and baked these without any help from me or her mum. These turned out to be very delicious indeed and needless to say made the father's day that extra bit special for me.
