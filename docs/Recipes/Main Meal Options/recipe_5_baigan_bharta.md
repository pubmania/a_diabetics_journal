Roast the pierced Aubergine using a #gas stove or an oven{} for ~{15-20%minutes} if using gas stove and ~{30%minutes} if using oven, turn it in between. 
Don't rush to turn as slight burns are good and give it a smoky flavour.
Remove the Aubergine from fire / oven and let it cool, remove the skin and take out the soft pulp in a #bowl{}.
Mash the pulp using #potato masher{} and make a rough paste.
Now add @Ghee{2%tbsp} in a #frying pan{} on the #hob{} and heat it.
Chop the onion{1%large} using #knife{} and add to the #frying pan{}.
Saut√© it for ~{2-3%minutes}, and then add crushed @garlic{3-4%cloves} and chopped @ginger{1%inch}.
Pour in the chopped @tomato{1%large} and @green chillies{4-5%deseeded and finely chopped}.
Add @Pink Himalayan Salt{to taste} and cook till the tomato melts, keep stirring with a #spatula{} to prevent burning at the bottom.
Once the mixture is turning brownish, add the mashed aubergine and mix well.
Start cooking over high flame while stirring till the mashed aubergine starts turning a bit brownish
Adjust @seasoning{} and Garnish with @Green coriander{1%small bunch, chopped}.
