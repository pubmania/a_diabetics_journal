Goes well with [Sparkling Cinnamon Drink](../Drinks/recipe_001_sparkling_cinnamon.md).

The Garlic Bread tastes great with [Minty Basil Mushroom Soup](../Snacks%20and%20Sides/recipe_007_minty_basil_mushroom_soup.md).

    As this recipe is based mainly on wheat gluten, it is not suitable for those with Gluten Intolerance. I am sure it's obvious but still.

**Common Prep Steps**

Add @Olive Oil{1%tbsp} and @sugar{1%tsp} in @water{300%ml} and mix well.
Take a #bowl{} and add @vital wheat gluten{1%cup}.
Add @wheat bran{1/4%cup}, @oat flour{1/4%cup}.
Add @flax meal{1/4%cup}, @Almond Flour{1/2%cup}.
Add @baking powder{1%tsp}, @salt{1%tsp}, @dried yeast{7%gms(1 sachet)}.
Add liquid mix to dry mix and knead for ~{5%minutes}.
Once consolidated, place the dough on oiled #baking sheet{}.
Flatten it with hand at first and with #roller pin{} later to bring it to about 14 inch diameter. 
If you want your pizza to be round then using a #large round utensil{} as guide and #knife or pizza cutter{} trim uneven sides to get a circular shape else just use the #knife or pizza cutter{} to make a rectangular shape.
Cover it with a slightly damp cloth and keep it aside to rise.
Use the trimmed dough to make another ball of dough and flatten it first with hand and then with roller pin to a size of roughly 8 to 10 inch.
Let the two items rise for a ~{40-60%minutes} though leaving for about ~{2%hrs} gets better results.

**Garlic Bread**

Take the smaller base and Using a #fork{} pierce the base equidistantly.
In a #microwaveable bowl{} take @salted butter{30%gms}.
Using a #grater{}, grate @Garlic{3-4%cloves(Large)} into the #microwaveable bowl{}.
Place the #microwaveable bowl{} into #microwave{} for ~{20-30%seconds}.
Using an #oil brush or spatula{} spread the melted butter and Garlic onto the smaller pierced base.
Put this into the #oven{} at 180°C for ~{10%minutes}.
Take it out after that and cut it into rectangular pieces using #pizza cutter{}.

**Pizza  Toppings**

While any topping can be used, I started by cutting @Yellow Capsicum{35%gms(1/3)} with #knife{}.
Then cut @Brown chestnut mushrooms{30%gms(3-4)}, @onion{50%gms(1/2)} and @canned pineapple{50%gms(1 ring)} using #knife{} and keep them separately for later use.
Cut @Paneer{125%gms} and put in a #small bowl{}.
Add @virgin olive oil{2%tsp}, @tandoori masala{2%tsp}, @dried fenugreek leaves{2%tsp} and @Pink Himalayan Salt{to taste} and mix well.

**Pizza**

Take the larger base and spread evenly [@pasta sauce{3%tbsp}](https://kutt.it/pesto-sauce) on it using #spatula{}.
Then spread a thin layer of @grated mozzarella cheese{40%gms}.
Add all veggie pizza toppings as much as possible without piling up and arranged side to side.
Then add paneer cubes, these can be piled on top of veggies, if there isn't enough space.
Now spread evenly @grated extra mature cheddar cheese{50%gms}.
Then add @jalapenos{10%gms(8-10 rings)}.
Finally sprinkle some more @grated mozzarella cheese{20%gms}.
Put this into the #oven{} at 180°C for ~{20%minutes}.
Take it out after that and cut it using #pizza cutter{}.
