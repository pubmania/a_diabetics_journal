The blog where I found this recipe is a treasure for people who love Indian dishes and has recipes reimagined the keto way but this is the one I have tried and it was delicious. The only change I made was replacing Xanthum Gum with Wheat Gluten.

The original recipe and video is on [this link](https://kutt.it/keto_gatte){target=_blank}.

Tastes great with [Tava Roti](../Breads/recipe_1_tava_roti.md), [Tandoori Roti](../Breads/recipe_3_tandoori_roti.md) and [Naan Bread](../Breads/recipe_4_naan_bread.md) and also goes well with [No Egg Wheat Gluten Bread](../Breads/recipe_2_wheat_gluten_bread.md).

    As this recipe uses wheat gluten, it is not suitable for those with Gluten Intolerance. I am sure it's obvious but still.
