Take @Aubergine{0.5-0.75%Kg(Black Large)} and make holes using a #fork{} on the skin.
Roast the pierced Aubergine using a #gas stove or an oven{}.
If using gas stove then for ~{15-20%minutes} else if using oven then for ~{30%minutes} while turning it in between.
Don't rush to turn as slight burns are good and give it a smoky flavour.
Take out the Aubergine from fire / oven and let it cool. 
Remove the skin and take out the soft pulp in a #bowl{}.
Mash the pulp using #potato masher{} and make a rough paste.
Now add @Ghee{2%tbsp} in a #frying pan{} on the #hob{} and heat it.
Chop the onion{150%gms(1 large)} using #knife{} and add to the #frying pan{}.
Saut√© it for ~{2-3%minutes}, and then add crushed @garlic{3-4%cloves} and chopped @ginger{1%inch}.
Pour in the chopped @tomato{100%gms(1 large)} and @green chillies{50%gms(4-5 finely chopped)}.
Add @Pink Himalayan Salt{to taste} and cook till the tomato melts. 
Keep stirring with a #spatula{} to prevent burning at the bottom.
Once the mixture is turning brownish, add the mashed aubergine and mix well.
Start cooking over high flame while stirring till the mashed aubergine starts turning a bit brownish
Adjust @seasoning{} and Garnish with @Fresh coriander{30%gms(1 small bunch, chopped)}.
