Roast the @pine nuts{40%gms} in the #pan{}, keep stirring with the #spatula{}. Care should be taken while roasting as these can burn quite quickly.

Once roasted, transfer them into a #bowl{} and let them cool down.
Grate @Extra Mature Cheddar Cheese{80%gms}. 
Peel @garlic{3%cloves} and roughly chop them along with @fresh basil leaves{100%gms} using a #knife{}.
Add all the above in a #mixer-grinder{} and add @fresh lemon juice{1%tsp} and @Extra Virgin Olive Oil{50%ml}.
After grinding for ~{15-20%seconds}, add @Extra Virgin Olive Oil{30%ml}. 
Grind again till a `paste` like consistency is reached.
Now pour the `paste` into a #clean glass jar{}. 
Cover the paste with @extra virgin olive oil{15%ml} and seal the jar tightly.
