!!! site-tip "Tip"
    The natural sweetness of Cinnamon makes it a terrific 
    drink and great healthy replacement for all popular 
    cold drinks and colas on market which are not good 
    for anyone but especially disastrous for diabetics.
    Anyway, the drink goes really well with [low carb pizza](../Main%20Meal%20Options/recipe_006_low_carb_pizza.md) and
    works well at all other social occasions.
