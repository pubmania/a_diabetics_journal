## What is this site about?

This site is a journal of a diabetic who for a very long time was not aware of very simple measures he could take to get his diabetes under control. It also provides various recipes that do not spike the blood glucose of this diabetic.

## What am I trying to do?

I am trying to document experiements I undertake - *both in the life and in the kitchen* - to keep a control on my blood glucose levels through diet and to avoid any medication or insulin dependency.

As most of the changes I try and apply are in diet and fasting regime, most of the journal perhaps will be different recipes I have tried. 

- No point documenting the unsuccessful recipes but the ones that worked are what I will record. 

- For lifestyle experiments, there is possibly an advantage in recording both positives as well as negatives - though there might be lack of motivation to record failures. We shall see. 

Then there are observations based on my lived experience, my deductions - may not be right but will reflect my understanding at that point in time.

Finally, I come across some very useful sites and will be trying to record them here as well so I can refer back should the need arise.
